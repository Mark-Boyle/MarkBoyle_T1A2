        <article class="blog-post-text">My decision to learn to code came from a desire to challenge myself. I had come to a point in my landscaping career where I could comfortably do everything that was required. There were always little challenges that occurred but overall I wasn’t learning and growing. 
            I wanted a change to stimulate and challenge me. I’ve always been curious about coding. The idea of building something with my mind is highly appealing. I love the algorithmic thinking and problem solving, and the world of tech has so much to offer in that regard. 
            I started learning by using the mobile app ‘Mimo’. Each morning I would spend an hour going through the exercises and I started getting hooked. I loved learning new skills and being able to create things with my new skills.
            It didn’t take long for me to decide that I wanted to pursue a career in software development.
